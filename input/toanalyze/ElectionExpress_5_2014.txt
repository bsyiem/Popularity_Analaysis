 Roughly 2/3rds of the crowds in @narendramodi rallies are between 18-28. You should see the hope in their eyes when they listen to him EE31 
 Best way to observe rally is by being among crowds. In Rahul's rallies most are disinterested. In @narendramodi rally they lap up every word 
 Lots of over night road building happening near Amethi. Wonder what's the rush. Everyone's had plenty of time EE30 pic.twitter.com/dBBfFGP7NR

 Seems like the roads have taken a toll. After 9000km marathon run across the country in a month, now undergoing repairs in Sultanpur. 
 I was in Amethi yesterday. People asked me "Does Amethi look like the constituency of someone as powerful as Rahul Gandhi?" What's your say? 
 Start the day with a smile :) @rprasad66 http://ow.ly/i/5slI8
